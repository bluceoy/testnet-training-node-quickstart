    "description": "The goal is to train a specialized legal analysis model designed to detect and identify potentially unfair, predatory, or one-sided clauses within legal documents. The model's objective is to not only flag problematic language but also to provide clear, plain-language explanations for why a clause may be considered unbalanced or non-standard. By referencing established consumer protection principles and common legal vulnerabilities, the model will aim to demystify complex jargon and enhance legal transparency for non-experts.",
